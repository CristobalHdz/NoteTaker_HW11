`Express.js: Note Taker`

by Cristobal Hernandez

Deployed Heroku URL: https://sheltered-cliffs-63986.herokuapp.com/


# Section 02: General Information
Complete code with what we have learned. We need to modify a starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

# Section 03: My experience
I think that a lot of time we are using software that we barely used. `Heroku` is a cool deployment tool, but really difficult to navigate through, most of this Homework's time was applied into getting to know the app.

The coding part of the homework was really easy once the right path was known, got some friends to help me through the homework.
